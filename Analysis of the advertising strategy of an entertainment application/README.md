# General conclusions

**Reasons for inefficiency in attracting users:**
- Advertising in the USA: low retention of paying users from the Facebook channel
- Tip Top Channel: CAC Growth
- AdNonSense channel: low user retention
- reduced conversion of customers using PC
 


**Recommendations:**
- increase the retention of paying users from the Facebook channel in the USA or redistribute its budget in favor of other channels
- redistribute the budget of the Tip Top channel in favor of other channels
- increase the conversion rate of PC users - add an activator on the site or find another way
- increase the advertising budget in Europe via lambda Media Ads and LeapBob channels, in the USA via YRabbit and MediaTornado (to increase the conversion rate according to the latter). Channels have a high ROI
