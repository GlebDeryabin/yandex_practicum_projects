**Objective:** to identify patterns that determine the success of the game

**Work plan:**
1. Loading and description of data

# General conclusion

The project investigated data about games from open sources. They contain information about copies sold by region, the year of release of the game, genre, rating and ratings of users and critics. The goal is to identify patterns that determine the success of the game.

As a result of working with data:
* data processed: gaps are filled in, data types are converted and an additional column is entered
* a research analysis of the data was carried out, which showed that:
    * the average lifetime of the platform is 10 years
    * current at the moment are games for PS4, XOne and Wii tablets
    * it is worth selling extra-popular games for popular platforms
    * when choosing games for sale, you need to look at the ratings of critics, not gamers - according to their estimates, the correlation with sales is higher.
    * Recommended genres for advertising - "Shooter", "Action", "Sports", "Role-playing games".
    * The markets of Europe and North America are very similar and very different from the Japanese in both genres and platforms.
* ????Hypotheses have been tested. Download Version 1: Average user ratings for Xbox One and PC are different. Hypothesis 2. Renaissance: Central Asian ratings of action genres and sports events.????

The patterns that determine the high sales of the game can be distinguished: belonging to a popular genre, access to a popular platform, high critical ratings.
Assuming that the store belongs to the European market, the games that are worth betting on when developing marketing activities are identified.

List of games: "Grand Theft Auto V", "Uncharted 4: Horse War", "Witcher 3: Wild Hunt", "Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain", "Bloodborne", "Dark Souls II", "Overwatch".
