# Formation of a mobile game monetization model

**Project Description:** Developers have launched a mobile game "Space Brothers". In it, users build their space program and try to succeed in the difficult task of colonizing the galaxy. The first users are already playing, and their involvement is working. However, the main monetization of the game has not yet been implemented: it is assumed that this will be an ad display on one of the screens. There is a contradiction in such mechanics: if you show ads early, the user may get angry and leave, if it's late, the fewer players will remain and will bring developers less money. The analyst is faced with the task of choosing the optimal time for displaying ads. Solution requirements: advertising should pay for attracting users after they reach the first level, the amount of advertising should be minimal.

# Game sales data analysis

You need to identify the patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns. Here is the data up to 2016. Let's imagine that it's December 2016, and you're planning a campaign for 2017. We need to work out the principle of working with data. It doesn't matter whether you forecast sales for 2017 according to 2016 data or 2027 according to 2026 data.

# Dashboard "User interaction with Yandex Zen cards"

**Project Description:** Almost all of your time is spent analyzing user interaction with article cards. Each card is defined by its theme and source (it also has a theme). Examples of topics: "Beauty and Health", "Russia", "Travel". Users of the system are characterized by the age category. Let's say "26-30" or "45+". There are three ways users can interact with the system: The card is displayed for the user (show); The user clicked on the card (click); The user viewed the card article (view). Every week novice managers Denis and Valeria ask me the same questions. I decide that it's time to automate the process. The dashboard will be based on a pipeline, which will take data from a table in which raw data is stored, transform the data and stack it in an aggregating table.
