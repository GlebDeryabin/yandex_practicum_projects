# Project conclusions

**During the implementation of the project:**
* The initial data were processed. Omissions were found. Their number is significant, but it is impossible to fill them without distorting the results. Additional articles have been created for data analysis. A small number of duplicates and rows with abnormal values have been removed.
* The analysis of public catering enterprises in Moscow by categories of establishments, the number of places in them, distribution by grid and non-grid, administrative districts, etc.
* According to the same criteria, a detailed review of enterprises such as "Coffee Shops" was conducted in order to form recommendations for the investor.

**The main conclusions on all public catering enterprises are formulated:**

* The most popular category is cafes, it includes 2316 establishments. The rarest category is a bakery, with a total of 252 establishments. The categories of cafes and restaurants each make up about a quarter of all establishments. Bars and pubs have on average the highest rating of about 4.4. Fast food establishments and cafes have the worst rating, from 4.04.

* The median number of seats varies between 60-80.

* In the data set under consideration, non-network establishments exceed network ones and correspond in the number of 5966 to 3084. The highest share of chain establishments is 0.6 in the bakery category. Next come pizzerias and coffee shops - the share of chain establishments in these categories is about 0.5. The most popular chains are: Chocolate Shop, Domino's Pizza, Dodo Pizza and coffee shops.

* Most of the establishments are located in the CAO. Least of all - in the NWAO. In all districts except CAO cafes are the most common establishments. The highest rating and the average check are also in CAO establishments. The streets where the most establishments work: Mira Ave., MKAD, Trade Union st., Leninsky Ave. If we talk about the only establishments on the street, then more often than in general, these will be cafes with a significantly smaller number of seats.

**Recommendations for opening a coffee shop**
* Location: Do not choose a CAO and consider a VAO to open a private coffee shop. Intersections of main streets should be considered. Preobrazhensky district.
* Working hours: weekdays from 7:00 to 22:00 and weekends from 9:00 to 22:00.
* Rating: you should count on at least 4.3 and strive for more. 
* The cost of a cup: 170-230 rubles
* Number of seats: 60-80, but you need to investigate the traffic.

**Recommendations for the development of the study**
- Explore the location of coffee shops relative to the metro, offices and universities.
- Connect a list of promising streets to the study.
- Explore the menu, styles and quality of interiors, music, speed of service.
- Connect the economic part.
