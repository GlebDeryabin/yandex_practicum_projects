**Description:** Almost all of your time is spent analyzing user interaction with article cards. Each card is defined by its theme and source (it also has a theme). Examples of topics: "Beauty and Health", "Russia", "Travel". Users of the system are characterized by the age category. Let's say "26-30" or "45+". There are three ways users can interact with the system: The card is displayed for the user (show); The user clicked on the card (click); The user viewed the card article (view). Every week novice managers Denis and Valeria ask me the same questions. I decide that it's time to automate the process. The dashboard will be based on a pipeline, which will take data from a table in which raw data is stored, transform the data and stack it in an aggregating table.

# Conclusions

As a result of working on the project, an interactive dashboard has been created, with the help of which it is possible to study the interaction of users with Yandex Zen cards in retrospect, in sections by age of users, topics of cards and sources.
For example, a general look at the available data from the dashboard shows:
- The number of interactions with cards from 18:53 to 19:00 was the maximum and amounted to 60 thousand.
- Most of all interacted with cards on the topic of "Science" (from 3 to 8% of the total)
- Cards from sources with the theme "Family relations" receive the most interactions (10.7%)
- 3471 interactions received "society" cards from sources with the topic Russia
